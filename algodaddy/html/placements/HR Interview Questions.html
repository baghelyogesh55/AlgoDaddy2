                                    <p>I think the worst mistake I ever made at work was in my first ever job - five years ago now. A more senior member of the team seemed to take an instant dislike to me from the start, and one day she was particularly
                                        unpleasant to me in front of several colleagues. </p>
                                    <p>Later on, I was talking to one of those colleagues who was, I thought, attempting to console me. Angry and hurt, I foolishly vented my feelings and told her what I thought of the lady in question. I was naturally shocked
                                        to find out that she went on to tell everyone what I had said and this certainly didn't help my relationship with the team member who was causing me problems. </p>
                                    <p>Rather than let the situation carry on, I chose to have a quiet word with this lady to find out what her problem was with me and to see if we could put it behind us. It turned out it was nothing personal; she just resented
                                        the fact that a friend of hers had also been interviewed for my position and had been turned down. Once we had got matters out into the air, her behavior changed, and we got on quite well after that. However, I
                                        certainly learned a lot from experience. I learned that careful communication is vital in managing interpersonal relationships and that if I have a problem with someone, it's always best to talk it over with them
                                        rather than with someone else.</p>

                                <blockquote>Before some time, public speaking has been a challenge for me. I was very nervous and hesitate while giving any presentation, so I started taking public speaking seminars to improve it. Now, I still get nervous before pitches,

                                <h3 class="h3">40) Explain the difference between group and team?</h3>
                                <p>The difference between group and team are as follows:</p>
                                <blockquote>There is only one difference between the group and the team. That is unity. Any set of people who stand together without any purpose or goal can be called as Group. Whereas, when more than 2 people work towards a common
                                    goal, can be called as a Team. For example: If you assign work to a group, then the work will be divided between the members and each member will work out their part, without any coordination with the other members
                                    of the group. On the other hand, if you assign a project to a team, they will collectively take the responsibility and work together with the goal to achieve the desired result. In a team, the members will cooperate
                                    and coordinate with each other at all times.</blockquote>
